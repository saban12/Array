////search element in an array and return the number of occurrences
const str = 'To be, or not to be, that is the question.'
let count = 0
let position = str.indexOf('e') // starts from the first occurrences so it wont get counted twice

while (position !== -1) {

  position = str.indexOf('e', position + 1)
